A css design tool for PyQt.

PYQT DESIGN TOOL FOR PYTHON DEVELOPERS
Hello friends. I designed a design tool for PyQt developers. As is known, the PyQt class supports CSS. This software I designed will help those using CSS in PyQt.
Objects you can design in the program:
    QLabel
    QPushButton
    QLineEdit
    QTextEdit
    QRadioButton
    QCheckBox
    QComboBox
    QSpinBox
    QSlider
    QListWidget
    QGroupBox
    QTabWidget
    QDockWidget
    QMenu
    QScrollBar
You can design these objects and more like "hover, pressed, marked, indicator, close-button, tab-bar, title".
